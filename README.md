# SPDX

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhi-kumar17871/spdx.git
cd spdx
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
composer install
```
5. Run the code
```bash
php index.php
```
## Note
I have included the spdx2_to_3.json generated from latest FOSSology and then converted to SPDX-3.0 using https://github.com/spdx/tools-python to compare the **@graph** part with the output file. The package used for testing is **Twig-1.43.0** package.
